        We are a community inspired by the example of Dorothy Day.

        We provide takeout dinners each weekday from 5:30pm-6:30pm. Volunteers can arrive at 5pm to help setup and
        serve, or at 6:15pm to help clean up.

        We are always in need of volunteers, financial contributions, new community members, and your prayers.

        DID YOU KNOW? Friendly House provides over 1,600 holiday meals to families in need yearly.

        The agency also distributes over 6,000 toys for Christmas. We are able to do this with the assistance of
        dedicated volunteers from various schools,

        companies and people who just want to help! Area schools help provide our programs with volunteers and interns
        that are actively pursuing careers

        as well as participating in community minded classes aimed at developing professionals. Volunteers get to help
        with a variety of activities within Friendly House!

        ​John Street Baptist Church makes every attempt to take care of its members, and also provide services to the
        city of Worcester and beyond.

        The Soup Kitchen Ministry was started in 1983, with $40 donated by ten female missionaries, a Becker college
        student, and Marjorie Wilson – a JSBC member.

        The Soup Kitchen, in partnership with the Food Bank, and volunteers from local churches, has grown significantly
        over the years.

        The Soup Kitchen feeds 50 to 70 people every Saturday morning, and serves an average of over 300 meals a month.
        The Soup Kitchen has only been closed a few times since its establishment.
